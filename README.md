# This is Oleg's investigation.

## ## Thank You for not giving up and exposing this scam project Oleg !

I have made a list of addresses that belong to some accounts on exchanges.<br>
If you are good with etherscan then please try to look what was happening on these addresses yourself.<br>
Or you can move to the next page to the story:)

### A small introduction

All dropil ICO addresses were funded with drops a year ago from<br>
`0x925ea5af075bde17811e4bcdc198dc5d3675e466 (dropil vault).`<br>
To receive tokens you should claim it using **dropil.com** and when you do it your address gets some ether from technical wallet<br>
`0xb30f2f834f19b3836ad326e51affbf9219c130a8`<br>
for paying txfee for transfer drops to an address that you choose.
