# This is Oleg's investigation.

## ## Thank You for not giving up and exposing this scam project Oleg !

I have made a list of addresses that belong to some accounts on exchanges.<br>
If you are good with etherscan then please try to look what was happening on these addresses yourself.<br>
Or you can move to the next page to the story:)

## Note that the list is not full and there can be a lot more interesting addresses to check later.

### A small introduction

All dropil ICO addresses were funded with drops a year ago from<br>
`0x925ea5af075bde17811e4bcdc198dc5d3675e466 (dropil vault).`<br>
To receive tokens you should claim it using **_dropil.com_**<br>
and when you do it your address gets some ether from technical wallet<br>
`0xb30f2f834f19b3836ad326e51affbf9219c130a8`<br>
for paying txfee for transfer drops to an address that you choose.

I will tell about just a little part of interesting addresses and transactions,<br>
but I also have made a scheme with much more information<br>
and a _lot of mutual connections of involved addresses_.

## Chapter 1\. **He has his reasons to do so !**

So here is an example:<br>
Some sleeping ICO address like<br>
`0x01ecbc76cdc5b8d4941e02dfe34a6b59dbcaf1c2`<br>
receives some ethers from `0xb30f` .<br>
After that drops are transferred from `0x01ec` to another address.<br>
<br>
The owner of ICO address `0x01ec` has chosen to transfer his 18 millions of drops to<br>
`0x942e07971838c920f31e878c136e0f72cc6d5bc1` - ( This address belongs to an account on IDAX exchange )<br><br>
`0xbd6d79f3f02584cfcb754437ac6776c4c6e0a0ec` - ( is the main IDAX wallet),<br>
so you can see `0x942e0` transfers tokens to `0xbd6d` ).<br>

_Here I need to say that some of exchanges allow users to generate new address for each<br>
incoming transaction but on the most part of exchanges (including IDAX, Tidex and Bitmart)<br>
each account has its own address for incoming token and ether transfers and it cannot be changed by user._

This IDAX account with `0x942e0` address received lots of tokens from sleeping ICO addresses<br>
and from one address that was involved in DEX system. Later we will look at this address closer.<br>
There I need to note that we talk about just one address that got _75 million drops_ **directly from ICO addresses.**

But who can say that it is not some crazy guy?<br>
Maybe he invested in ICO hundreds of thousands USD and he has never put 90% of his drops to DEX<br>
and used so many ICO addresses because he had his reasons for it.<br>
Yes maybe, so just let us go further.

## Chapter 2\. **Was it a crazy guy or not ?**

Centralized exchanges are not so good for investigations like this because incoming and<br>
outgoing txns cannot be connected with each other without knowing data from an exchange.<br>

An exceptions are decentralized exchanges like IDEX where you have one wallet for incoming<br>
and outgoing txns.<br>

Let us look at ICO address `0x525eb48b57e69f3a35e348c4955d37081e282942` .<br>

You see a txn of 3 millions of drops from `0x525eb` to IDEX exchange and then you can see an _internal txn of 26.5 ethers_ on this address which mean withdrawal from IDEX after selling drops.<br>
I rememeber that day when I thought that it was some crazy guy who suddenly realized that he has _3 m drops_ and then sold it at any price.<br>
He could get _~ 40 ethers_ at the price then but he got just _26 ethers_.<br>
So maybe it is just a crazy guy who needed fast money ?

Let us check who sent ethers to this address `0x525eb` .<br>
Maybe it was `0xb30f` as it happens in normal cases?<br>
No, it was not `0xb30f` !<br>
`0x525eb` got ethers from ethereum hub `0xfd7f71d7f0e8e47b04009fb7237f708092e51d9c`<br>
and `0x525eb` sent ethers back to `0xfd7f7` after selling drops.<br>
Such behavior is quite unusual for ICO addresses for dropil :).<br>
The hub `0xfd7f7` got a lot of ether from Tidex (surprise) and it has really interesting transactions. Let us look closer at the address<br>
`0xfd7f71d7f0e8e47b04009fb7237f708092e51d9c` .<br>
`0xfd7f7` sent some ether to `0x460570ceffd7c8c35586ff8fec1f635a4907a624` - it is an ICO address that also got dividends from DEX.<br>
And suddenly `0x460570` sent drops to `0x942e07971838c920f31e878c136e0f72cc6d5bc1` - to the IDAX account wallet described in the previous section.<br>
We have our first connections but let us go further and I will show you a lot more!<br>

## Chapter 3\. Covering tracks or leaving evidences ?

Later `0xfd7f7` sent ether to sleeping ICO address `0xcddc8a77d2c14b7d3c12f1bbca87cd0232c9b9f1`<br>
which sent its 12 m drops to `0x04b49a5c7433eb578b715ac23b9418ff41e1f5e3`<br>
which is an address of another IDAX account with a total income of _120 millions of drops_.<br>
To be honest there is a part of drops obtained from other exchanges but still the most part of these _120 millions_ is from ICO wallets.<br>
Using of these _complicated schemes_ with transfer from one exchange to another was done really bad,<br>
because it allowed me to find more connections with other interesting addresses.<br>
Let us look closer at `0x04b49a5c7433eb578b715ac23b9418ff41e1f5e3`<br>
`0x04b49` has got some part of tokens from `0x6a9717964154d72d43081b1a611197630a3aea49` that is very interesting for us.<br>
It is some little hub for drops that was used to cover tracks, but they had to do it much more carefully.<br>
`0x6a971` sent drops directly to<br>
`0x4bedb29721617e722e3b92950e547795b5182fb9 (Tidex, 75 millions of incoming drops)`,<br>
`0xdcfffa54ad7d3cd18c1876af6ef2ae1e1da7febe (Bitmart, just 16 millions )`,<br>
`0xae1402e65d3ad9b802d4e7304a0e722106960c7f (Tidex, 48 millions of incoming drops)`<br>
`0xae1402` got 16 ethers directly from initial ether hub `0xf4392fd61ecbe949121ea3e2951a9a21b69ace76`<br>
And so let us look at outgoing txns from this hub:<br>
<https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xf4392fd61ecbe949121ea3e2951a9a21b69ace76&f=2><br>
**The main address for the dropil system ( `0x925ea5af075bde17811e4bcdc198dc5d3675e466` ) was funded from this address for 5 times.**<br>
The second important address `0xb30f2f834f19b3836ad326e51affbf9219c130a8` also got ethers from this hub for paying fees.

### Ethereum (ETH) Blockchain Explorer Ethereum Transactions Information<br>

### Etherscan Transactions that have been mined and confirmed on the Ethereum Blockchain.<br>

The list consists of transactions from sending Ether and the transactions...<br>
So the wallet `0xf4392fd61ecbe949121ea3e2951a9a21b69ace76` definitely belongs to dropil team.<br>
Thus all other wallets mentioned above with all its connections also belong to the team.<br>
You can estimate the total number of drops sold on the exchanges and then you will understand what happened with the price.<br>
I did not mention all connections among all the wallets but I have shown here enough to have what to think about.
