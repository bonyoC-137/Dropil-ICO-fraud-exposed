I have made a list of addresses that belong to some accounts on exchanges.  
If you are good with etherscan then please try to look what was happening on these addresses yourself.  
Or you can move to the next page to the story:)

##### Note that the list is not full and there can be a lot more interesting addresses to check later.  

A small introduction  
All dropil ICO addresses were funded with drops a year ago from  
``
0x925ea5af075bde17811e4bcdc198dc5d3675e466 (dropil vault).
``  
To receive tokens you should claim it using dropil.com and when you do it your address gets some ether from technical wallet  
``
0xb30f2f834f19b3836ad326e51affbf9219c130a8
``
for paying txfee for transfer drops to an address that you choose.  

I will tell about just a little part of interesting addresses and transactions but I also have made a  
scheme with much more information and a lot of mutual connections of involved addresses.  

### Chapter 1. He has his reasons to do so
So here is an example:  

Some sleeping ICO address like
``
0x01ecbc76cdc5b8d4941e02dfe34a6b59dbcaf1c2
``
receives some ethers from 0xb30f.  
After that drops are transferred from 0x01ec to another address.  
The owner of ICO address 0x01ec has chosen to transfer his 18 millions of drops to
0x942e07971838c920f31e878c136e0f72cc6d5bc1 . This address belongs to an account on
IDAX exchange (main IDAX wallet is 0xbd6d79f3f02584cfcb754437ac6776c4c6e0a0ec , so you
can see 0x942e0 transfers tokens to 0xbd6d ).
Here I need to say that some of exchanges allow users to generate new address for each
incoming transaction but on the most part of exchanges (including IDAX, Tidex and Bitmart)
each account has its own address for incoming token and ether transfers and it cannot be
changed by user.
This IDAX account with 0x942e0 address received lots of tokens from sleeping ICO addresses
and from one address that was involved in DEX system. Later we will look at this address
closer.There I need to note that we talk about just one address that got 75 million drops
directly from ICO addresses.
But who can say that it is not some crazy guy? Maybe he invested in ICO hundreds of
thousands USD and he has never put 90% of his drops to DEX and used so many ICO
addresses because he had his reasons for it. Yes maybe, so just let us go further.
Chapter 2. Was it a crazy guy or not?
Centralized exchanges are not so good for investigations like this because incoming and
outgoing txns cannot be connected with each other without knowing data from an exchange.
An exceptions are decentralized exchanges like IDEX where you have one wallet for incoming
and outgoing txns.
Let us look at ICO address 0x525eb48b57e69f3a35e348c4955d37081e282942 .
You see a txn of 3 millions of drops from 0x525eb to IDEX exchange and then you can see an
internal txn of 26.5 ethers on this address which mean withdrawal from IDEX after selling drops.
I rememeber that day when I thought that it was some crazy guy who suddenly realized that he
has 3 m drops and then sold it at any price. He could get ~ 40 ethers at the price then but he got
just 26. So maybe it is just a crazy guy who needed fast money?
Let us check who sent ethers to this address 0x525eb . Maybe it was 0xb30f as it happens in
normal cases? No, it was not 0xb30f .
0x525eb got ethers from ethereum hub 0xfd7f71d7f0e8e47b04009fb7237f708092e51d9c and
0x525eb sent ethers back to 0xfd7f7 after selling drops. Such behavior is quite unusual for ICO
addresses f dropil :). The hub 0xfd7f7 got a lot of ether from Tidex (surprise) and it has really
interesting transactions.
Let us look closer at the address 0xfd7f71d7f0e8e47b04009fb7237f708092e51d9c .
0xfd7f7 sent some ether to 0x460570ceffd7c8c35586ff8fec1f635a4907a624 - it is an ICO
address that also got dividends from DEX. And suddenly 0x460570 sent drops to
0x942e07971838c920f31e878c136e0f72cc6d5bc1 - to the IDAX account wallet described in the
previous section. We have our first connections but let us go further and I will show you a lot
more!
Chapter 3. Covering tracks or leaving evidences?
Later 0xfd7f7 sent ether to sleeping ICO address
0xcddc8a77d2c14b7d3c12f1bbca87cd0232c9b9f1 which sent its 12 m drops to
0x04b49a5c7433eb578b715ac23b9418ff41e1f5e3 which is an address of another IDAX
account with a total income of 120 millions of drops drops.
To be honest there is a part of drops obtained from other exchanges but still the most part of
these 120 millions is from ICO wallets. Using of these complicated schemes with transfer from
one exchange to another was done really bad because it allowed me to find more connections
with other interesting addresses.
Let us look closer at 0x04b49a5c7433eb578b715ac23b9418ff41e1f5e3
0x04b49 has got some part of tokens from 0x6a9717964154d72d43081b1a611197630a3aea49
that is very interesting for us. It is some little hub for drops that was used to cover tracks, but
they had to do it much more carefully.
0x6a971 sent drops directly to
0x4bedb29721617e722e3b92950e547795b5182fb9 (Tidex, 75 millions of incoming drops),
0xdcfffa54ad7d3cd18c1876af6ef2ae1e1da7febe (Bitmart, just 16 millions ),
0xae1402e65d3ad9b802d4e7304a0e722106960c7f (Tidex, 48 millions of incoming drops)
0xae1402 got 16 ethers directly from initial ether hub
0xf4392fd61ecbe949121ea3e2951a9a21b69ace76
And so let us look at outgoing txns from this hub:
https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xf4392fd61ecbe949121ea3e2951a9a21b69ace76&f=2
The main address for the dropil system ( 0x925ea5af075bde17811e4bcdc198dc5d3675e466 )
was funded from this address for 5 times. The second important address
0xb30f2f834f19b3836ad326e51affbf9219c130a8 also got ethers from this hub for paying fees.

Transactions that have been mined and confirmed on the Ethereum Blockchain. The list consists of transactions from sending Ether and the transactions...
So the wallet 0xf4392fd61ecbe949121ea3e2951a9a21b69ace76 definitely belongs to
dropil team.
Thus all other wallets mentioned above with all its connections also belong to the team. You can
estimate the total number of drops sold on the exchanges and then you will understand what
happened with the price.
I did not mention all connections among all the wallets but I have shown here enough to have
what to think about.
